/**
 * The Either type represents values with two possibilities: a value of type
 * Either a b is either Left a or Right b.
 *
 * The Either type is sometimes used to represent a value which is either
 * correct or an error; by convention, the Left constructor is used to
 * hold an error value and the Right constructor is used to hold a
 * correct value (mnemonic: "right" also means "correct").
